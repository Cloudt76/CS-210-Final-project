# CS-210-Final-project
You are doing a fantastic job at Chada Tech in your new role as a junior developer, and you exceeded expectations in your last assignment for Airgead Banking. Since your team is impressed with your work, they have given you another, more complex assignment. Your task is to build an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer, which should incorporate all of their requested functionality.

The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers.
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving?
Overall the project was solving an issue for Corner Grocer, and they wanted a digital way to keep track of what items were selling fast.
What did you do particularly well?
I feel that overall I did very well with this project, and went above and beyond with what they had in mind.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have worked on the GUI more, instead of using a basic design. This would of made the software more visually appealing to use.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Overall the moist difficult part was doing the checks for the spelling of the grocery items, I had included a way that no matter which way you typed in the grocery items, whether upper or lower case, it would still populate an accurate result. When I was getting errors, I sat back and focused on other things until I was ready to come back to it and that helped me out a lot.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Problem solving skills are always being honed! OVerall the different ways of thinking about the problem and how to solve it will always be my biggest advantage.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable by making seperate functions in a class, for each of the menu options. I included many comments on what each part of the code was doing, to make it very readable. Its adaptable in the fact that its able to be upgraded with more options in the future!
